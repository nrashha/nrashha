## I'm Nahian Rashha, a rising senior at Amherst College studying Math and Statistics. 

I'm interested in the intersection of data science and impact and spend time thinking about issues of economic access and equity through a statistical lens. I usually code in Python and R with intermediate knowledge of Java. My projects are usually in statistical modelling, deep learning, and data analytics. Some of my most recent ones are: 

**Analyzing the Median Income of US Householders**: Used R to analyze US Census Bureau data and created informative visualizations to capture the distribution of median income by household owners’ highest educational attainment

**Currency Crisis Prediction using Macroeconomic Indicators**: Built a neural network in Python to predict currency crises from macroeconomic time series; applied mechanistic interpretability to uncover model biases and improve reliability

**Free-Market Competition Simulator**: Used Java to create a free-market simulator game where the user plays against the computer to solve prisoner’s dilemma matrices using their market knowledge of a product to beat their competitor
